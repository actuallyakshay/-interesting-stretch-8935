        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <p>Below you’ll find answers to the questions we get asked the most about our subscriptions</p>
    </div>

    <div id="faq">
        <details>
            <summary>Which subscription is right for me?</summary>
            No two companies are the same and no one should pay for what they don't need. It's exactly why we offer
            different pricing plans for different businesses – whether you're a large company, small team or
            moonlighting freelancer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before choosing a subscription, you can trial Timely free for 14 days. During your trial, you have unlimited
            access to all of Timely’s features, so you can work out which features give you the most value.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What happends when my trial ends?</summary>
            Once your trial period ends, everything you've tracked in Timely will be saved, so there's no need to rush
            into a decision. If you do choose to subscribe, everything—all your logged hours, projects, users, reports
            and memories—will be there as you left it.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you don't know how much time you have left in your trial, head to Settings > Subscriptions and check your
            trial counter in the top-right corner.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once your trial expires, you will need to purchase a subscription to continue using Timely. While you can
            still see the Memory history from your trial period even if you aren't subscribed, you won't be able to
            actually use any Timely functionality—like logging time or creating projects and reports—until you subscribe
            to a plan.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Where do I subscribe my Timely ?</summary>
            Your trial period has ended and you can't imagine going back to manual time tracking ever again. 💃💥 We
            know the feeling... Thankfully, it only takes a few seconds to find and subscribe to the right Timely plan
            for you.
            <ol type="1">
                <li>1. sign in to Timely</li>
                <li> 2. click the Settings icon on the left-hand navigation bar</li>
                <li>3. If you have any questions, just reach out to us through support chat or email
                    support@timelyapp.com and</li>
                <li> 4. choose Subscriptions and take it from there.</li>

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you offer discount ?</summary>
            At Timely, we offer two types of discount:
            1. Annual plan discount
            Get up to a 23% discount by signing up for a yearly subscription instead of a monthly one. Don't let that
            money fly out the door; take advantage of this and save, save, save!
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Student discounts
            Send us a note in our support chat or email support@timelyapp.com and we'll help you out. Please note, you
            must provide a valid student ID and valid student email to sign up.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>I'm missing features that were avelavble during my trial. What can I do ?</summary>
            During the free trial, you can access all of Timely's features. However, they may not be included in the final plan you choose to subscribe to.  You can see a full breakdown of what is included in each subscription by clicking on “learn more” on our pricing page
            <br>
            If you realize you're missing something crucial after subscribing, reach out to our Success team who can explain our plans and any in-app "upgrade" messages you may have encountered.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>None of these planes really fit my needs. How can I talk to ?</summary>
