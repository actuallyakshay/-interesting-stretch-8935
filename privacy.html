            <h1>Our privacy <br> promise</h1>
            <p>Unlike some time tracking tools, Timely has a strict anti- <br> surveillance policy. We don’t support
                employee <br> screenshots, keystroke monitoring, or any other spying <br> tactics—and we never will. If
                you’re looking for employee <br>monitoring software, Timely simply isn’t the tool for you.

            <p>As a remote business, we know how difficult it is to unify a distributed workforce and support people you
                never see in person—ensuring work stays visible, business hours are accurately recorded, and everyone
                maintains a healthy workload.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>But we also know that trust is central to every team. It’s why we’ve built a time tracking tool that
                helps keep teams connected without undermining their privacy and dignity. Timely places the power and
                benefits of time tracking directly into the hands of employees, giving people access to personal
                insights to help them better manage their time, create healthier schedules, and improve their work
                experience—and all without a creepy screenshot in sight.</p>

        <div class="boxII">
            <h1>Timely offers privacy by design</h1>
            <p>Every individual has the option to download our magical Memory app to their computer, which will
                automatically capture the time they spend in different apps and websites. All that data is recorded to a
                private timeline inside Timely, which they can use to log their timesheets. Crucially, only they can
                ever access that data. Here’s how we’ve made Timely creep-proof:</p>

            <div id="flex4">
                <div>
                    <p>No boss or colleague can see your data—your activity timeline is 100% private to you.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>You can use your data to log your timesheet — but nothing goes public without your active
                        involvement.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>You own your data—download or delete it at any time.</p>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Timely will never support spyware tactics—we don’t want to work with creepy businesses.</p>

    <h1 id="flexTwoH1" >Why we don’t offer employee surveillance</h1>
    <div id="flexTwo">
        <div>
            <h2>It’s unethical</h2>
            <p>While employers in Europe are required to tell employees if they are being monitored, in the US there is
                no such requirement. In fact, only three states have passed bills allowing employees to deny their
                employers access to their personal Facebook pages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As such, many employee monitoring tools are purposely designed to be incognito, often hidden from
                “Running Processes” so employees don’t know they’re being watched. We think this is a gross infringement
                of employee privacy and will never support such functionality in Timely.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>It destroys culture</h2>
            <p>Trust lies at the heart of the psychological and social contract between managers and their people that
                holds organizations together. Since employee monitoring erodes trust, it eats away at the very
                foundations of company culture. We believe respect for personal boundaries and professional dignity is
                elementary.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Companies should lead with empathy, foster psychological safety, learn how to better support employee
                wellbeing and—above everything—continually work to earn and honor the trust of their people.</p>
